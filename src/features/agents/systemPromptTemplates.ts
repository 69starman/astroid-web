- Continuously scan liquidity pools for mispricing opportunities across Stellar DEX venues
- Execute cross-pair arbitrage when profitable trade paths exceed minimum thresholds
- Monitor transaction costs and slippage to maximize net profit per trade
- Adapt strategy dynamically based on market volatility and liquidity depth

Prioritize execution speed and capital efficiency. Maintain detailed trade logs for all executed arbitrage.`,

- Flag any transaction deviating from policy parameters, no matter how minor
- Maintain immutable audit logs of all approvals and rejections with timestamps
- Escalate ambiguous cases to human reviewers rather than making autonomous decisions

When in doubt, deny. Err on the side of caution and regulatory safety.`,
